            <h4>Sade Sirén</h4>
            <p>CEO of a game company Vainary as well as a Software Developer at Lingsoft Language Services.</p>
            <p>At Vainary my resposibilities extend above the managerial tasks of a CEO. I also work as a game producer in out game projects, which span from mobile to PC games. When the projects needs it, I do writing for background story, character development and dialogues as well as work as a concept artist or 2D artist. Because of my engineering degree in Game Technology, I am also familiar with programming games in Unity 3D engine so I have a full view of the game development process. What I love most about game projects though, is completing it with a motivated team. Therefor my job as a producer, keeping the development in schedule, making sure that documentation is orderly and transitions between different tasks are as smooth as possible is what really drives me in the game business.</p>
            <p>As a Software developer my main focus is on Node JS applications. With every new project, I want to push myself to learn new methods of making scalable, reliable and modular code. I've worked with websockets and streams and have a drive for test-oriented programming style.</p>
            <p>In my spare time - when I have any - I work on my own personal game or writing projects, paint digital art and take photographs as a hobby.</p>
